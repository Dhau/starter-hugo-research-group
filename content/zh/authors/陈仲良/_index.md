Professor Johnny Chan is currently an Emeritus Professor at City University of Hong Kong. Before his retirement in June 2021, he was Chair Professor of Atmospheric Science and Director of the Guy Carpenter Asia-Pacific Climate Impact Centre. He was also the Founding Dean of the School of Energy and Environment of City University of Hong Kong, serving from the founding of the School in July 2009 to July 2015. Between 2002 and 2008, he was also the Director of the Shanghai Typhoon Institute of the China Meteorological Administration.

Prof. Chan is internationally renowned in the research areas of typhoons and monsoons. In the last few decades, he has been working on the problem of global warming and its relationship with tropical cyclone and monsoon climate, as well as the impact of urbanisation on local and regional climate. He has published close to 270 international journal articles and given over 300 invited talks and conference papers. According to the Essential Science Indicators, he ranks the top in the world in the number of SCI-listed journal articles related to tropical cyclones, and is the ninth most-cited author in this field during the 1996-2006 period.

Prof. Chan was a member of the Tropical Meteorology Research Working Group of the World Meteorological Organization and the Chair of its Tropical Cyclone Panel between 2012 and 2018. He is also an associate editor of three journals: International Journal of Climatology, Atmospheric and Oceanic Science Letters and Acta Meteorological Sinica, and a member of the Editorial Board of World Scientific Series on Earth System Science in Asia. In Hong Kong, he is a member of the Science Advisory Committee of the Hong Kong Observatory, and an advisor of the GreenPlus Programme and was a member of the Advisory Group on Advanced Metering Infrastructure, both of China Light & Power Company Limited.

Prof. Chan’s honours include Honorary Fellow of the UK Energy Institute, Fellow of the American Meteorological Society, recipient of the International Journal of Climatology Award of the Royal Meteorological Society, Distinguished Meteorologist awarded by the Hong Kong Observatory, and a Senior Research Fellowship awarded by the Croucher Foundation.
